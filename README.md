Map SNMP OIDs to MIBs

###### our documentation

We have adopted from the official documentation and created our own.

This tools expects the following:

- clone this repo
- all mib files go into a device folder
- all device folders go inside the mibs folder

You can specify a device to create mappings for

```python
m = MIBS(SmidumpFormat().xml)
m.generate_map()
```

Otherwise it will generate maps for every device folder, and save the maps inside its device folder

###### from documentation
```shell script
smidump --level=1 -k -f python RFC1213-MIB > RFC1213-MIB.dic
```

_Note: `.dic` extension is **mandatory**_
